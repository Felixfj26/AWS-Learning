[AWS Solutions Architect — Associate test] : <https://www.netcomlearning.com/amazon-web-services-training/vendor/104/?advid=1356&utm_source=ayush&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=aws>


I began my AWS cloud adventure about a year ago with Netcom Learning’s AWS training and. Along the same time, I drew inspiration from numerous LinkedIn contacts
“It is essential to follow common interests individuals and organizations in any job you have since it makes it simple to acquire knowledge and learn quickly.”

I chose to take the test relatively late. Still, I work on AWS services daily in my present business, so having only a certification without any hands-on experience would not be valued when you appear for interviews. If you are newly introduced to the cloud or AWS, I recommend that you begin with AWS cloud practitioner courses or training.
Now I’ll go over the preparation route I took when I chose to take the test two months ago. It may depend on everyone’s efforts, so someone might finish this in a month as well, but don’t rush to pass the exam. Take your time!

## I took the following steps:

I purchased Netcom’s Learning AWS course, which is, in my opinion, the top-rated course on the industry: It is a well-structured course that covers all of the topics needed to pass the test. I also watched several YouTube videos for test preparation and sample questions, which helped me prepare for the exam.
Amazon S3, Amazon VPC, Amazon SQS, Route 53, and Amazon EC2 are all critical issues to consider. There were also a few straightforward queries on AWS Lambda and Amazon FSx.

Please complete the test preparedness training available on the AWS training website before taking the exam — Exam Readiness: AWS Certified Solutions Architect — Associate (Digital). This is mostly two hours lengthy, but it covers essential subjects and gives you a concept of how the questions are asked.

Finally, I recommend that you go through the practice tests provided by Netcom Learning. It is worth purchasing because it includes scenario-based questions and, after passing the test, you will receive a detailed explanation of where you went wrong. Start completing practice tests at least a week before your actual exam date.

Set a timetable for the exam and schedule it once you are confident enough. Take this exam seriously since it will put your knowledge of AWS services and real-world scenarios to the test. So plan ahead of time and stick to it! You will undoubtedly succeed.
AWS certifications are a tool to help you achieve your objective. Best wishes with your AWS adventure! Good luck with your studies!
